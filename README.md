# CarbonHeaders

This repository contains an updated version of the
[CarbonHeaders-18.1 Apple open-source package](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CarbonHeaders/CarbonHeaders-18.1/),
which has not been kept current for several macOS releases
now. The newer versions are required for compatibility with
newer Apple open-source packages as used in the PureDarwin project.
